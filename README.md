# arkworks::additional-curves

The arkworks ecosystem consist of Rust libraries for designing and working with *zero knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments (zkSNARKs)*. This repository complements arkworks:algebra by providing additional elliptic curves.

**IMPORTANT:** This repository contains elliptic curves with small prime order groups, which do not satisfy standard security parameter recommendations. 

This library is released under the MIT License and the Apache v2 License.

**WARNING:** This is an academic proof-of-concept prototype, and in particular has not received careful code review. This implementation is NOT ready for production use.
